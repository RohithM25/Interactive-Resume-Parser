The goal of this project is to provide a recruiter with a chatbot assistant to help them screen resumes. The web application takes in a resume, and has a chatbot feature that allows them to ask questions about it.

---------------------------

To get API functionality, enable "Live server" VScode extension. Then there will be a button in bottom right corner to click that says "go live".
Click that and it should open the app in your browser

Full Project:
Run the code from the .ipynb file and it will create an output text file. Then downlaod that text file and feed as input to the chat bot.
The two pieces (parser and chatbot) were not able to be integrated in time.

When using the webapp, remember to click the "choose file" button in the top left corner to select the parsed resume as a txt file.
After a parsed resume is selected, you can know ask the chatbot questions about the candidate.
